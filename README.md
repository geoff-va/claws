Laws for your Configuration files

**NOTE**: This is very much in a POC phase and is likely not functional yet

## Introduction
Provides validation for your configuration files via a declarative toml file, autogenerated for you and kept up to date.

Planned support for the following file types, though likely extensible:
- `.env`
- `.json`
- `.ini`
- `.toml`
